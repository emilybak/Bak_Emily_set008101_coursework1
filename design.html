        <h1>Welcome to my Design Page!</h1>
        <h2>The elements that I have used in this project consist of change in text color when hovering over a link,
        adding images to give the user a idea of what type of cypher they will be using. Sizing and spacing of these images
        were also implemented. Design was kept simplistic for the user, so there would be no confusion or problems.
        For the cypher pages, the Caesar cypher contained a new option that allows the user to choose the offset of letters that
        they would like, the ASCII cypher allows the user to choose if they would like to convert in uppercase or lowercase.</h2>
